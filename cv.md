## **About Me**

I want to become a coder who will be able to create useful and easy-to-understand applications of high quality and 
demand for people and organizations. And it doesn't matter whether it is a front-end, back-end or full-stack.

My social skills are quite developed, my style in work is pedantic. I love learning from people and mentoring people.
Despite being a freelancer, I am a team player and ready to look for compromise in work if necessary.

With my law degree, I have worked for NGOs, international organizations, governmental agencies and private sector. 
I have never worked as coder, despite of completing a 2-years courses of JavaScript full-stack web-developer of the 
IT-Attractor school, here, in Bishkek, due to consequences of COVID that led to worsening of my health state. And 
recently I was diagnosed with remission. It allowed me to enroll to the Pre-School where I hope to successfully regain
and refresh my level of understanding in web development and get a dream job.
